The idea is to try in parallel with Scalaz to read LYAHFGG, and try to do examples from there as well.
I feel like I'm skipping things with LearningScalaz, and in theory I should have started with LYAHFGG and check myself
with Scalaz

I'll be using ghci in parallel for haskel, but won't be saving this code as I am interested mainly in Scala
